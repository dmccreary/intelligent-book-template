# Concept Enumeration

!!! prompt
    You are an expert at generating precise lists of core concept labels that used in high school and college courses.

    Below is a course description of a course on [SUBJECT] I am teaching at a local [HIGH SCHOOL, COLLEGE or University]. Please generate a list of the 200 core concept labels that need to be covered in this course and the order in which they should be taught.

    Return a numbered list of these core concept labels using a single line per concept. For each concept, just return a short concept name and use acronyms or abbreviations if the concept names are too long. These concept labels will be used as labels in a graph network and will
    be visible inside or below a node in a graph drawing. 
    
    Make sure that the concepts are distinct not duplicated in the list.

    Start with the most basic foundational concepts and then proceed to the most complex concepts.
