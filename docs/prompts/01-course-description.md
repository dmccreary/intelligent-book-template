    Please generate a detailed course description for a 10-week class on the subject of [SUBJECT].
    
    The course description should be written in Markdown.  Follow Bloom's 2001 taxonomy.

    The audience is [advanced high-school students or freshmen in college].

    First, list the prerequisites for the course including any math or science courses
    needed before the class begins.


    The focus of the textbook is a series of interactive simulations (MicroSims) that allow the students to learn the SUBJECT.

    We start with simple concepts and then build deeper understanding of the advanced concepts.  

    The course ends with students creating their own capstone projects that teams or individuals present to their peers.  Peer evaluation is a key component of the course assessment.
